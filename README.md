# Hatchling3DPrinter
High speed, tiny form factor printer meant for easy abs functional parts (really quick of course) or stupid fast benchies.

80mm^3 build volume with about a 20.5cm^3 footprint. Full 2020 extrusions, nema 17s (2504acs stock), and support for many hotends using the v0 v0 toolhead (with adapted mounting). MGW7C linear rails with a 2020 cf tube x beam. Custom machined aluminum bed gantry. 

BIG credit to the Tiny-M and Voron 0.1/V0 V0 for some electronic and panel mounting inspiration, Tiny-M specifically for idlers and motor mounts (modified obviously), Voron specifically for extruder and hotend basis. Credit to Nitram for the volcomosq and volcomosq mounting (which has been modified for bowden). 


KEEP IN MIND: This is a major work in progress. Any and all designs/parts are subject to change if not complete redesign/removal.
